    /**
     * Provides intelligent skill recommendations for a candidate to improve their job match scores.
     * <p>
     * This method analyzes ALL job postings in the system.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm works as follows:
     * <p>
     * 1. For each job posting, calculate current similarity score with the candidate
     * 2. For each skill the candidate is MISSING (present in job but not in candidate profile):
     * - Temporarily add that skill to candidate's profile with level equal to the max. required
     * level across all job postings
     * - Recalculate similarity score
     * - Calculate improvement: new_score - old_score
     * 3. Aggregate (sum up) improvements across all job postings for each missing skill
     * 4. Return top N skills ranked by total improvement potential
     * <p>
     * Results are sorted by:
     * 1. Total improvement score in descending order (highest impact first)
     * 2. If improvement scores are equal, by skill name alphabetically (case-sensitive)
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * - Candidate has: {Java:4, Python:3}
     * - Job1 requires: {Java:5, Python:4, AWS:3} - similarity: 0.905
     * - Job2 requires: {Java:4, AWS:4, Docker:3} - similarity: 0.500
     * <p>
     * Missing skills analysis:
     * - Adding AWS:4 to candidate → Job1 similarity becomes 0.972 (improvement: 0.067)
     * - Adding AWS:4 to candidate → Job2 similarity becomes 0.780 (improvement: 0.280)
     * - Total AWS improvement: 0.347
     * <p>
     * - Adding Docker:3 to candidate → Job1 similarity becomes 0.776 (improvement: -0.129)
     * - Adding Docker:3 to candidate → Job2 similarity becomes 0.670 (improvement: 0.170)
     * - Total Docker improvement: 0.041
     * <p>
     * Result: [SkillRecommendation(AWS, 0.347), SkillRecommendation(Docker, 0.041)]
     * <p>
     * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
     * The platform's default similarity strategy is Cosine Similarity (considers skill levels).
